    "description": " Sometimes you just get so angry that you need to flip a table over, throw a keyboard, or even throw some other people. It\u2019s natural, we get it.

Check out the last couple of emotes and see that you can go completely crazy and throw not one but two people! One in each hand! I don\u2019t think you can express your anger any more clearly than this. ",
