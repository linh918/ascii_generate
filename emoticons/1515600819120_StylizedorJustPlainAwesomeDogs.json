    "description": " Some of these dog emojis look much better than the rest of the emotes in the dog category. Otherwise, they have their own unique style or they are somewhat famous. Jake from Adventure Time is in this mix, are you able to find him? The ੯ੁૂ\u2027̀͡u emoticon is really unique because of the profile view it has of the dog\u2019s face. These two are definitely my favourite.  ฅ^\u2022ﻌ\u2022^ฅ ੯ੁૂ\u2027̀͡u (❍ᴥ❍ʋ) \u208dᐢ\u2022ﻌ\u2022ᐢ\u208e*･ﾟ｡ ཥමཙමཤ ং\u201d ა ",
