Naturally, Pikachu comes first and he even has two different text faces. Find other famous Pokemon, like the big ol\u2019 snoring Snorlax (go ahead, add some zz\u2019s!), or Muk, who\u2019s mouth is wide open in that classic, \u201cmuuuuuuuuk\u201d sound. These emoticons really go to show how creative you can get with creating your favourite characters.
