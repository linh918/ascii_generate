    "description": " These kaomojis are scratching their head in confusion, which is a pretty classic gesture. They are trying to figure something out. There are a lot of great characters perfect for scratching arms, including ヾ, ゞ, ﾌ , ଽ , and〈. These kaomojis usually have petty neutral expressions to get across their confusions, but you can also make them look happily confused or maybe a tad bit frustrated!
