If you put the eyes close to the ground with characters such as a period (.) or a low circle (。) then it looks like the emoticon is very absorbed in their writing. Their face is basically on the page. Sometimes underscores are used to show the paper that they are writing on. ψ(。。) ___ψ(\u2025 ) ＿ψ(°-°=) ψ(°ρ°*)メ \u201cψʕ\u2022ᴥ\u2022oʔ ψ(´ω｀●) ψ(-｀Д´-*) ..ψ(ｰ￣*) ψ(・∀・＠) ψ(・⺫・\u2036) \u2026.ψ(･ω･。) _ψ(-c_,-。) ",
