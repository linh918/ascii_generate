  "description": " These kaomojis are excited while facing towards the left. Now that you have seen the kaomojis that move both left and right, you can try combining them as if they are having an interaction. Why be happy alone when you can be happy together! These emotes are flexible, you can choose any facial expression or arms as long as you make one side of the body bigger than the other. This achieves the effect that they are looking a certain way.  ヽ(;^o^ヽ) ╰(✧∇✧╰) ٩(◕ั ∀◕ั๑٩) ٩(\u2022౪\u2022٩)三 \u208d\u2022͟ ͜ \u2022 \u208e q(^-^q) ＼（・c＿・●）ゞ ۹⌤_⌤۹ ヾ(０∀０*★)ﾟ*･.｡ ヾ│・ェ・ヾ│ ╰(・∇・╰) 。（＞ω＜。） ヾ(･ω･｡)ｼ ヾ(･д･ヾ) ヽ(´∀｀ヽ) ヽ(´ω｀○)ﾉ.+ﾟ*｡:ﾟ+ ヾ(≧∇≦*)ゝ ",
