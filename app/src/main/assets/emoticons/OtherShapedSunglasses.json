  "description": " These are kaomojis with sunglasses of different shapes such as diamonds or circles. These use the characters ◆ and ●. Use one of these kaomojis if you are feeling especially spectacular today and want to show off your unique flare with diamond or circle shaped glasses. If you love John Lennon or if you are a hippy, the circle shades will also work nicely for you.  凸（◆◆メ ヾ(*●Д●)ﾉ゛ -●-●-ヽ(｀∀´)ゝ ♪(*・д・)ﾉ●-● ヾ(●ε●)ノ (*´∀｀）ヽ＜◆－◆＞→（*◆T◆） ",
