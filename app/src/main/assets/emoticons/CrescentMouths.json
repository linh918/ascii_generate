  "description": " These dongers have a sort of crescent or half circle character used for their worried looking mouth. This mouth looks like a frown as I have never heard of anyone feeling happy and worried at the same time! Choose from any pair of eyes to play around with the subtle emotion tied to the worry. Poor worried emotes, hopefully their worries pass over. (๑ó⌓ò๑) (●´⌓`●) (꒪⌓꒪) ଽ꒰⌓̈ ॢ꒱ ̉ ̉ ( \u2022᷄⌓\u2022᷅ ) (´๑・⌓・｀) ( ꒪ͧ⌓꒪ͧ ⊂ ( ³⌓³) (๑°⌓°๑) (;ↀ⌓ↀ) (◕⌓◕;) Σ(\u2018◉⌓◉\u2019) (ὀ⌓ὀ⑅) ",
