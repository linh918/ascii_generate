  "description": " These are the perfect text faces to use when you need to give someone the slow clap. These emoticons are all a little sarcastic and they are not actually all that impressed about whatever they are clapping about. Use characters like ƪ , ʃ , or ۶ to show this action. You can either have the hands right beside one another as if they are touching and making a clapping sound, or you can leave a space as if the action is in motion and the hands are still coming together. ƪ(ƪ꒪ৱ৹)ᵒʰ˵˵ (#´∞｀∫)∫ ƪƪ\u2019▿\u2019) (\u2018▿\u2019ʃʃ (\u2022\u2019╻\u2019\u2022 ۶)۶ ",
