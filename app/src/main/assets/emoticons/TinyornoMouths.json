  "description": " These emoticons don\u2019t have mouths, or maybe they just have really tiny ones. Nonetheless, they still manage to convey just how happy they are! This is because the focus is mostly on the eyes, which are always pointing in one direction or another, as you can see with the characters ^, ⌒ and≧. Having no mouth or a tiny mouth comes off as super cute, too.  (o^^)o ヾ(^ ^ゞ o(^^o) (o^^o)♪ (o⌒．⌒o) (=^･^=) 。(⌒.⌒。) ( ﾉ^.^)ﾉﾟ (\u201c⌒.⌒\u201d) (≧.≦*) (*^^*) ",
