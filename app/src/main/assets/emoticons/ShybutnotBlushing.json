  "description": " You can tell by looking at these emojis that they\u2019re shy or embarrassed even though they\u2019re not blushing. Sometimes the eyebrows give it away, or else the expression of the eyes. I can almost hear them letting out slow little, \u201cheh heh heh\u201d chuckles under their breath. They might even be embarressed about something but are hoping nobody notices.
