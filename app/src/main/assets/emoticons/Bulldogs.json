  "description": " These are bigger-sized emoticons and look (to me at least) like bulldogs. Their faces are not only big, but when the eyes are made using ￣, it looks like there are rolls of skin on the dog\u2019s face. This is typical for bulldogs and really, without this effect you will really lose out on the bulldog look. Check out the cute wagging tale made with ヾ! These are happy bulldogs!
