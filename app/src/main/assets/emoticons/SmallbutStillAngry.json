  "description": " These kaomojis are all similar looking. They may be quite small but they are still rather angry. These emotes go to show that size does not matter and even the smallest of us can get riled up with rage! They all appear small because very small characters are used for their facial expressions and their arms. Don\u2019t doubt how powerful these little guys can be. They may be small but they are not holding anything back. ",
