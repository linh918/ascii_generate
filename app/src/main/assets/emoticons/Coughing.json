  "description": " These emotes are coughing and using a 3-like character with some lines makes an excellent cough. It looks like a little poof coming out of their mouths.

Make sure the emotes always have an open mouth as if they are coughing. ε-(≖д≖﹆) ε-(＞．＜;; ε=o(´ﾛ｀||) ((( +д+)o=3=3 ε-(>o<) (；≧∇≦) =3 （●｀□´）＝з",
