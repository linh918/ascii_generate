  "description": " As if bear emojis were not small enough, these are similar to the ʕ\u2022ᴥ\u2022ʔ style Japanese Emoticons except they\u2019re extra tiny. Itty bitty characters are used for the faces in order to achieve this size. There is no need for excessive detail with these Japanese emotes. Oh my goodness, the smaller a bear is, the cuter it seems to become!   ˁ˙˟˙ˀ ˁ˙͠˟˙ˀ ˁ˙͡˟˙ˀ ˁᵒ͡ˑ̉ᵒˀ ˁ῁̩ˀ \u207d͑˙˚̀Ꮉ˚́˙\u207ẻ ˁ῁͓ˀ ˁ῁̭ˀ ˁ῁̮ˀ ˁ῁̱ˀ ˁ῁̥ˀ ˁ῁̼ˀ ˁ῁̩ˀ ˁ῁̬ˀ ˁ῁̯ˀ ˁ῁̰ˀ ",
