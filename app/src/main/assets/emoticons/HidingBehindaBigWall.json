  "description": " These emojis use ┬┴┬┴┤ or ├┬┴┬┴ to make a brick wall that they are hiding behind. You can always see them peeking around the wall, sometimes showing both eyes or perhaps just one. It really depends on how sneaky or shy they are being. Because these emoticons are a little larger, it is best that you use them if there is ample space that will not break these emotes into multiple lines.  ",
