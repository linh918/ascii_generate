  "description": " These emoji emoticons are angry and facing towards the left because that is where their anger is being directed. Rely on the facial expression to get across how angry you are, because emotes that are angry towards the left can be anywhere from enraged to mildly upset. Place one of these emojis beside an emoticon that is angry to the right and see how much it looks like they are in an argument! You can even add an object like a sword or some words to convey a more elaborate scene. ",
