They might just be going a little crazy or even playing a sport and dodging someone on the opposite team.

You can simply add more of these clouds of dust to show how far these emotes have been sprinting. Honestly, it also looks a bit like a fart to me. Either way, it is a great way to show movement in a running emoticon. ε=ε=ε= (э^✪ｪ✪^)э ε=ε=ε=ε=ε=(ｏ゜\u2015゜)ｏ ε＝ε＝ε＝ε＝ε＝(ｏ・・)ｏ o(▼Д▼ﾒo)=3 =3 =3 ε=ε=((( ^-x-^)ﾉ ε=ε=ε=ε=ε=ε= ◟( ⚫͈ω⚫̤)◞ (･ω･｡)ﾉ=з=з=з ε=ε=ε=ヾ(э^・ｪ・^)э ε＝o(*\u2019◡͐\u2019)o （´□｀；）=З=З=З=З=З=З o(￣･･￣o)))=3 ",
