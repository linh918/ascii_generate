  "description": " These are kaomojis that are engaged in some form of movement. They could be crawling, rolling, stretching, and so on. There are so many other actions for an emoticon to be doing so here are a few of them related to movement. You have to use your imagination a bit to see that movement. Crawling The crawling ones are all seen from the side view. For some reason some of them have numbers for faces, but I won\u2019t question it. These other action emoticons are unique because they are seen from the profile, as the majority of emotes don\u2019t show the entire body. This goes to show how creative an emote can get! ＿|￣| ⍤\u20dd ＿|￣| ⍨\u20dd ＿|￣| ⍤\u20dd _|￣|⑱ _|￣|⑬ _|￣|⑪ ",
