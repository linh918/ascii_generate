    "description": " These text faces are dancing with their arms up while facing to the right. Dance steps have to take an emoji somewhere, so it may as well be to the right. They are absolutely hilarious with some of their expressions. They can look really smug while dancing, or even surprised. Do you know what your face looks like when you dance? Probably not, but try anyways to pick a dancing emoticon that looks the most like you!
