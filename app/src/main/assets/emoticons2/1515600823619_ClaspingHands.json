    "description": " You can use a characters like ʃƪ or 人 to make the emote look like it\u2019s clasping its hands together as it goes in for a kiss. This makes the kiss appear especially darling and it looks like a gesture full of love. These clasping hands can be put on either the left or the right side of the emoticon so that it can face either direction. I don\u2019t know why, but I can\u2019t help but imagine these emoticons are standing on their toes.
