They look pretty silly while giving a salutation, as if they are not totally serious. Use these if you are making a joke or poking fun at something. You definitely don\u2019t want to send these saluting emoticons to a drill sargeant. (；・ε・)ゝ\u201d (★ゝз･)ﾉ~* *~ヽ(ゝз･☆) (`･ε´-ゞ) (〃´3\u2032〃)ゞ ヾ(´ε｀*)ゝ (･´з`･)ゞ ヽ|･з･|ゞ (｡･з･)ゞ ヽ( ˘з˘ )ゝ ",
