    "description": " These Japanese emoticons simply use the English letter v for a mouth, which can either be upper or lower case. You can decide which case to use as it really just depends on how big you prefer the smile to be. No matter what eyes you use for these emoticons, the v mouth keeps them looking pleased. Go ahead and experiment with different possibilities!  (*´・ｖ・) (*＾v＾*) （＾ｖ＾） (▰˘v˘▰) (n˘v˘\u2022)¬ (´｡･v･｡｀) ♡✧( ु\u2022⌄\u2022 ) ( \u2022⌄\u2022 ू )✧ (⌯⌅⌄⌅) ῍̩̞(∗ɞ⌄ɞ∗)◞ (\u2032ʘ⌄ʘ\u2035) ",
