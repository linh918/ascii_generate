    "description": " These emojis use the Korean character ᄌ to make their mouths. These are also pretty simple, standard sorts of bears. We recommend using the character option ㉨ if you want to make a snout. This makes the emoticon look more like a bear. Aside from the mouth, you can make these bears doing anything you like, whether it be moving to the left or right, looking forward, or showing a particular emotion like happiness, sadness, or anger. There is a lot of freedom for expression with these emoticons!  (✪㉨✪) (ó㉨ò) ・㉨・ (♥ó㉨ò)ﾉ♡ ヾ(;￫㉨￩)ﾉ ⊂(ο･㉨･ο)⊃ ✧(๑\u2022́ᄌ\u20ddก̀๑)⋆*ೃ:.
