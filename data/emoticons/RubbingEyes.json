  "description": " These kaomojis are all rubbing the tears out of their sad little eyes. This sad emoticon is perfect to use at the end of an intense crying fit or when these emoticons are sad because of something very small. Rather than crying, they are more so pouting and giving sad little \u201csniff sniff\u201d sounds. I\u2019m sure these emotes could use a good friend.
