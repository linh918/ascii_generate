    "description": " These are a few other miscellaneous dead dongers that did not belong in any other category. They all use a variety of different eyes, such as Ω, ヘ, ≖, *, and the English letter u. Can you think of a way to elaborate on these emoticons? If you have gone through the entire dead emoji section, you will know how to add graves, ghosts, as well as get inspiration from other dead emoticons so that you can make these miscellaneous dongers look more fancy.
