    "description": " There are actually quite a few creative looking ghost text faces. I\u2019m pretty impressed with some of these. They often have phantom hands, as if these ghosts were haunting someone in a really eerie way. These ghost hands can be made with the English letter m. There are angry ghosts, eerie ghosts, winking ghosts, and even ghosts that have adorable faces :3. Consider adding in the word \u201cboo!\u201d beside your ghost or even another emoticon running away in fear! Check out the scared category to find the perfect text face to combine with a ghost.   〓■●＿ ～ □○0 〓■●～～=□○0 m(~ー~m)～ ～(m~ー~)m m(~ｰ~m)~ 0(:3　)～ =͟͟͞͞(\u2019､3)_ヽ)＿ ꐑ(*ꐌ◡ꐌꐐ*)࿐࿔࿓ m(@益@m)～ \u2020┏┛墓┗┓\u2020 ~((～~~(m￣(ｴ)￣)m ・・・・・～～～～～～～(m￣ー￣)m ー=≡Σ[▓▓]ε¦)　　ー=≡Σ( ε¦) 0 m(ﾟДﾟm)～【\u2020】～(m´ρ`)m ",
