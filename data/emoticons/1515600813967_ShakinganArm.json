    "description": " These Japanese emoticons are angry enough to have raised one arm and they are shaking it around. Mind you, they are not quite angry enough to raise both of their arms. These emotes will let people know that you are definitely displeased and disapprove something, but you are still doing a good job at keeping your cool. Usually an emote will be shaking it\u2019s arm in the direction it is looking. ",
