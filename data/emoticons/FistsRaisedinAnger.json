Characters like ٩, ᕙ, ᕦ, ೕ or even an English letter P make excellent raised fists. This is the perfect way to show you are hovering on your limits and that you are very close to exploding with anger!  ٩(╬ʘ益ʘ╬)۶ ٩(๑`ȏ´๑)۶ ｏ( ><)o o(>< )o ᕙ(⇀\u2038↼\u2036)ᕗ ᕦ(ò_óˇ)ᕤ ٩(╬ఠ༬ఠ)و ٩(๑`^´๑)۶ ٩(//̀Д/́/)۶ ٩(╬ʘ益ʘ╬)۶ p( Ò \u2038 Ó)q  \\\\٩(๑`ȏ´๑)۶// ＼＼\\\\٩(๑`^´๑)۶//／／ ୧ʕ ⇀ ⌂ ↼ ʔ୨ ୧༼ಠ益ಠ༽୨ o(｀Д´*)o ୧▒ \u2022̀ o \u2022́ ▒୨ !! o(*≧д≦)o)) o(-`д´- o) ୧(๑\u2022̀ᗝ\u2022́)૭ ೕ(Ò⺫ Ó )೨ o(｀□´)○ ฅ(๑*д*๑)ฅ!!
