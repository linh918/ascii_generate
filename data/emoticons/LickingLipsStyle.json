  "description": " These dongers are licking their lips with a ൧͑ character for their mouth and tongue. They must be waiting to eat something delicious. Depending on what eyes they have, these dongers can look upset, happy, neutral, or even patient. Using upset eyes like ತ, ᓀ, or ˭in combination with this style of licking lips makes these emotes look hangry (so hungry that they are getting angry!). ತ ൧͑ ತ (๑ ˭̴̵̶᷄൧̑ ˭̴̵̶᷅๑) (ර൧ර☆) (ತ ൧͑ ತ) ໒( ᓀ ൧̑ ᓂ )७ [ ☉ ൧̑ ☉ ] ԅ|.͡° ൧͑ ͡°.|ᕤ ʕっ˘൧̑˘ςʔ ╰། ❛ ൧̑ ❛ །╯ (っ˘൧͑˘ς) (๑╹൧͑╹๑) ʕ ∗ \u2022́ ൧͑ \u2022̀ ∗ ʔ (∩❛൧͑❛∩)",
