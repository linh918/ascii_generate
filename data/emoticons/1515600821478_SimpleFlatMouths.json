    "description": " These are some simple Japanese emoticons with flat, happy mouths. These flat mouths are made using either _, -, ー, or ▂ . Everything else about the emoticon is flexible, including it\u2019s eyes, whether or not it has arms, words, or other fancy decorations like stars (☆). This style of emoticon is classic as well as easy to make. ( ^_^)／ (^ _ ^)/ （＾_＾） (^-^*)/ （￣ー￣） (∩_∩) (∩▂∩) (☆^ー^☆) （ｖ＾＿＾）ｖ p(*＾-＾*)q ",
