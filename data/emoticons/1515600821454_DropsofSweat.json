    "description": " These kaomoji emoticons are giving up on something with a drop of sweat on their foreheads. This is just like an anime character who has a drop of sweat slide down their face. These emoticons either feel disappointed, tired of trying, or embarrassed. In all cases, they are accepting their defeat and they are giving up on something. The perfect drop of sweat is made with ; and it is possible for you to add more than one.
