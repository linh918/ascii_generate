  "description": " These Japanese emoticons use a circle-like character for their cheeks to indicate that they\u2019re blushing from either shyness or embarrassment. This style of shy emoticon is pretty toned down because the blush is so minimal. Using a darker blush, like with the character ●, does make it a bit more intense if that is what you want to go for.  （。-＿-。） (｡･･｡) (o・・o)/ (●ฅ́дฅ̀●) ( 。\u2022_\u2022 。) (●˙꒳˙●) (●°u°●) 」 (｡uωu｡) ღ✉ღ\u2022̥̑ .̮ \u2022̥̑) (o´∪｀o) |´∀｀●) ",
