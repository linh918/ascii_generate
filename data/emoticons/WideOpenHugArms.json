  "description": " These kaomojis are ready to give a big hug and are showing it with their wide open arms. They are so happy, loving, and friendly that anybody could step into a hug like that! Send this to a friend if you want to offer them a hug, because it is obvious these emotes are offering a hug to whoever they are looking at! Use hearts for eyes with ♡ to add to the love or use crazy eyes like ◉ to send someone running from the hug.  ⊂((・▽・))⊃ ＼(^o^)／ d=(´▽｀)=b ⊂(◉\u203f◉)つ ⊂（♡⌂♡）⊃ ⊂( ◜◒◝ )⊃ ",
