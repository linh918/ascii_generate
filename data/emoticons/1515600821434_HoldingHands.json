    "description": " These friendly dongers are holding hands with their friends, family, or their lovers. It can also look like they have crossed their arms together, just as a couple would do while going on a date or walking down the street. Human connection is so important and these emoticons are showing how fulfilling friendship can be. These are also great emotes to use if you are cheering someone up.  └(^o^ )Ｘ( ^o^)┘ ＼（＾∀＾）メ（＾∀＾）ノ ヾ(￣ー￣)X(^∇^)ゞ \u2039(\u207d˙́ʷ˙̀\u207e )∨( \u207d˙́ʷ˙̀\u207e)\u203a (ી(΄◞ิ౪◟ิ\u2035)ʃ) (ી(΄◞ิ౪◟ิ\u2035)ʃ) (*◑∇◑)☞☜(◐∇◐*) ヽ(ﾟ▽ﾟ*)乂(*ﾟ▽ﾟ)ﾉ ☆(*^o^)乂(^-^*)☆ ☆^v(*^∇\u2019)乂(\u2018∇^*)v^☆ (ﾉ*´･、>･)乂(・ι_・｀*)ﾉ ━(p´･∀･)乂(･∀･｀q)━ (ﾉ￣∇￣)乂(￣ｰ￣ )ﾉ ♪(・∀・*)乂(*・∀・)ノ ",
