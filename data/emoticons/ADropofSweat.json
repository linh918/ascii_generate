  "description": " These kaomoji emoticons did something they\u2019re embarrassed about because they\u2019ve got a single drop of sweat to indicate this. Again, this is a lot like an anime character when they are feeling somewhat shy and a bead of sweat falls down the side of their face. This is great for those times that you realise you have done something wrong and you made a mistake. It is for those \u201coops\u201d moments. ",
