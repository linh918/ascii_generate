Whether one kaomoji is being empathetic to a friend\u2019s sadness, or if a friend is cheering up the other, it always helps to pass through sadness with a friend close by. Use one of these emoticons if you want to help cheer up a friend or if you n eed some cheering up yourself. You can also use it if you are being really sappy with someone and you are both crying.
