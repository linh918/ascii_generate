  "description": " These are kind of rabbit like facemarks that are saluting and have an x for a mouth. Check out the rabbit category to learn how you can add some rabbit ears to these saluting rabbits. Otherwise, they can be seen as regular facemarks that have their mouth shut as if they are not allowed to speak. They are also being respectful by saluting.
