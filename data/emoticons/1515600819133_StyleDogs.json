    "description": " The character ᴥ makes a fantastic looking dog nose and mouth. These emotes all use this character and as a result they all look exactly like dogs. Despite having the same mouth, these emoticons still manage to look very different from one another. Some have arms, some don\u2019t even have heads, and others use very expressive eyes. These are all ways to make a dog emoticon stand out, even if they all use the same character for a mouth.  ◖⚆ᴥ⚆◗ ⎩ ♨ᴥ♨ ⎭ -ᄒᴥᄒ- [⑇◍ᴥ◍\u2022⑇] (ノ ̿ ̿ᴥ ̿ ̿)ノ ୧༼◕ ᴥ ◕༽୨ ᕙ༼◕ ᴥ ◕༽ᕗ (_/¯⊘_ᴥ_⊘)_/¯ ⊆ↂᴥↂ⊇ ⎰≀.⎔ᴥ⎔≀⎰ ⊂▶ᴥ◀⊃ °˖✧◝(ਠᴥਠ)◜✧˖° (っ⊂\u2022⊃_ᴥ_⊂\u2022⊃)っ ●ᴥ● ヽ(°ᴥ°)ﾉ └(°ᴥ°)┘ ┏(°ᴥ°)┓ へ║ ◉ ᴥ ◉ ║〜 乁[ ◕ ᴥ ◕ ]ㄏ (\u2037\\(ᓄ ᴥ ᓇ)/\u2034) ▐ ☯ ᴥ ☯ ▐ ໒( ̿ ᴥ ̿ )७ ໒( ◉ ᴥ ◉ )७ | * O ᴥ O * | ٩། ಠ ᴥ ಠ །ᕗ ୧╏ ~ ᴥ ~ ╏୨ ⋋〳 ￣ ᴥ ￣ 〵⋌ ╏ ◯ ᴥ ◯ ╏ ੧〳 ˵ ಠ ᴥ ಠ ˵ 〵ノ⌒.
