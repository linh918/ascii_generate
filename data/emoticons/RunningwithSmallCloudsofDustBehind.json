  "description": " These text faces, on the other hand, I guess aren\u2019t running as fast because they have little clouds of dust behind them made with the characters \u207c³\u208c\u2083. They could be out for a jog or a trot. Either that or these emotes are just smaller in general and the clouds of dust match the size of their little feet. As long as it still looks like they are running then I am happy to put them in this category.  뮻\u207c³\u208c\u2083 ٩뮹۶\u207c³\u208c\u2083 (`ન̇´) \u207c³\u208c\u2083 (ↀДↀ)\u207c³\u208c\u2083 ٩(ै ̀ ๔ิ ́ )۶༴ \u207c³\u208c\u2083 ٩(\u2022ི̛ᵋ\u2022̛)ྀ۶\u207c³\u208c\u2083 ",
