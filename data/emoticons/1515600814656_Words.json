You can add these words beside any emoticon in the angry section, so here are the words on their own in case you want to copy and paste them somewhere else: ᑦᵒᔿᵉ ᵒᐢᵎᵎ , Ƒ ư ɕ ƙ . The letters are always fancy because they come off as way cooler than regular English letters. Also, do not hesitate to add a whole bunch of explanation marks to amp up the anger!!!! ",
