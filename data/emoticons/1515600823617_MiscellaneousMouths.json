    "description": " These dongers are kissing too, but they use other miscellaneous characters to make their kissy lips. There are so many possibilities for kissing mouths, and they are all super adorable. I especially like when the emoticons are blushing because it shows they are really nervous about giving a kiss. It could even be their first kiss! ;)  (#^.^#) （´・｀ ）♡ ˓( ˶ ❛ ꁞ ❛ ˶ )˒˒ ϵ( \u2018Θ\u2019 )϶ (╯⊙ ⊱ ⊙╰ ) (✿ꈍ。 ꈍ✿) (\u2018\u207eʚ\u2019\u207e*)ू \u208d \u2044\u2044\u2044 ຶᵦ \u2044\u2044\u2044 ຶ\u208e (ﾉ￣〓￣)ﾉ ヾ(￣〓￣ヾ) ヾ(´〓｀)ﾉ ",
