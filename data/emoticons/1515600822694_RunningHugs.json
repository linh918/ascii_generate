    "description": " You can stick some running characters like ───==≡≡ΣΣ to any right facing hugging emotes to make some running hugs. This shows them running at top speed to give a hug to someone in need! Or maybe they are running to hug a loved one that they haven\u2019t seen in a super long time. There sure is a big cloud of dust behind them, no matter the reason! You can also use similar characters behind emoticons running toward the left. ───==≡≡ΣΣ((( つºل͜º)つ ─=≡Σ((( つ◕ل͜◕)つ ─=≡Σ((( つ ◕o◕ )つ ～～～～(/￣ｰ(･･｡)/ ───==≡≡ΣΣ(づ￣ ³￣)づ ─=≡Σʕっ\u2022ᴥ\u2022ʔっ ───==≡≡ΣΣ(> ^_^ )> ─=≡Σ༼ つ ▀̿_▀̿ ༽つ ───==≡≡ΣΣ(っ´▽｀)っ ───==≡≡ΣΣ(っ´∀｀)っ ～～(つˆДˆ)つﾉ>｡☆)ﾉ ",
