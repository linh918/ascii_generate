    "description": " These saluting text faces all use a square character for their mouths. This mouth is interesting because it can convey so many different emotions depending on how you approach it. I mean, they can look really sad, really dumb, surprised, or even happy. Just change your perspective to play around with it. If you want it to look a certain way, you can always use the eyes to clarify the emotion you wish to express.  （〃・ロ・〃）ゞ (*´□`)ゞ ヽ|･ロ･|ゞ ( *๑\u2022̀ロ\u2022́๑)」 ( ゜ロ゜)ゝ (･´□`･)ゞ (｡･□･)ゞ ヽ( ˘□˘ )ゝ (＞ロ＜)ゝ ",
