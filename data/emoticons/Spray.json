  "description": " The character 鹵 makes a great looking spray bottle. These emojis are spaying something out of the bottle. It could be water or maybe acid? The Kanji 炎 means lots of fire so some of these are spraying fire which is a bit scary. On the other hand, they could be spray paint bottles as an emoticon goes in to graffiti on an abandoned building.  !!( ･_･)r鹵~<巛巛巛 !!( ･_･)r鹵~<巛巛巛(x_x) !!( ･_･)r鹵~<巛巛巛(ﾟoﾟ; ( ・∀・)ｒ鹵~<≪巛;ﾟДﾟ)ﾉ ヽ|・∀・|ｒ鹵～＜巛巛 （　＾）／占~~~~~ ( ﾟДﾟ)ﾉ占~<巛巛巛 ( ▼▼)/鹵<<≪≪《《〈〈 巛 ( ◎_x)/ !!( ・_・)r鹵~<炎炎炎炎炎炎(ﾟ■ﾟ;;)ﾉ (○ゝ｀ω･)ｒ鹵~巛殺殺殺殺殺殺殺殺殺殺 ヾ((( ﾟ<炎炎炎炎炎炎炎ﾉ;ﾟﾛﾟ)ﾉ炎炎炎 ",
