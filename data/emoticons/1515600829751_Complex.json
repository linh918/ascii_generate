    "description": " These Japanese emoticons are a little bit more complicated and might not display correctly on every device. Some of the characters they use are just not recognized on every browser or device. If you are having issues, then try changing browsers. I always say that Safari is the best browser to use to get complex emoticons to show up properly.
